To download the compressed folder containing the files for the webiste, follow the instructions below.

For Windows, click website.zip. This will lead to the file page, where no view is given due to the size of the upload. Simply click download, or click 'View raw' and then download. In your desired location, extract the folder contents, and view.

For Linux machines, click website.tar.gz, and follow the same download procudure as outlined for Windows machines. 

A note about the project: keep all files together in one folder, and do not attempt to view while the folder is still compressed. Unzip first to get best results. In the folder, you will find either image files (as seen by their extensions) or .html or .css files. When .html files are clicked, they will load into the default browser and display there. Once the folder is downloaded, the source files may be edited (no binding permission or authorization properties). If you wish to maintain the integrity of the project for judging purposes, DO NOT edit the .html or .css files OR delete any of the image contents in the folder. This project is compatible with nearly all browsers, although the ideal display is with Mozilla Firefox. 

On a final note, photos of the submission can be found in the folder 'Photos'. These are intended to support the submission and do not offer any actual value to the functioning of the project.
